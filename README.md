### Open the directory and run the script line:

#### Install Packages

```bash
yarn
```

#### Testing

Create a `test.env` file in the root directory and include the following entries:

```bash
PRIVATE_KEY=""
PUBLIC_KEY=""
FROM_ADDRESS=""
TO_ADDRESS=""
WALLET_ADDRESS=""
```

Then run:

```bash
yarn test
```

#### build for node

```bash
yarn build:node
```

#### build for browser

```bash
yarn build:browser
```

This will create a file called `lib/browser.js` which can be included in your project.
See `example/vanilla-example/index.html` for a basic integration example.

#### Cipher base fix

You may encounter an error building to the browser due to cipher-base. Open this file:
`node_modules/cipher-base/index.js`

And replace the imports with the following:

```
var Buffer = require('safe-buffer').Buffer
var Transform = require('readable-stream').Transform // replacing instead of "stream"
var StringDecoder = require('string_decoder').StringDecoder
var inherits = require('inherits')
```
